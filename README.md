## Description
A two-screen movie Application built using Swift and SwiftUI that displays the latest movies fetched from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) which can be filtered either by 'top rated' or 'most popular'.
- [Top Rated](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-top-rated-list)
- [Popular](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list)

## Architecture and Tools Used
- The application is built using Swift and SwiftUI.
- I made use of Async/Await for networking because of its short and straightforward syntax.
- I used [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for downloading and caching the images as they are data consumptive. Kingfisher improves UX, by not having to download every image whenever the user closes and opens the app.
- I used the Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) architecture.
